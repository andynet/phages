## Whole genome alignment howto
- lift over construction between two different species

The commands seem to contain errors and hardcoded stuff. It is also not explicit what software needs to be installed.

## A practical guide to using TBA
Overview:
- generating a series of pair-wise alignment
- generating a multiple alignment
- projecting the alignment onto a reference

`all_bz` runs a series of `blastz` commands


## GSAlign
- https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6569-1
- two groups of alignment algorithms:
    - seed-and-extend
    - seed-chain-align
- seeding schemes:
    - K-mer
    - minimizer
    - suffix tree
    - suffix array
    - BWT

This is probably not what I am  searching for.
